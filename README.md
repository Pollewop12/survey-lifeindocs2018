# Survey results: live in docs 2018

The repository contains the anonymized source data from the "Life in docs 2018" survey. This survey was created as the first of a new commitment to open sourcing any community and product research that we are doing at [Corilla](http://www.corilla.com). 

The intention is that this open source process provides value for the community and any other projects within this sector. Especially for the content teams.
